The *Markov Chain ðŸ¥¨ Text Playground* is a web-based tool that takes an input text and generates an output text through next-character or next-word prediction. The interface includes clean-up features (removing line breaks and extra spaces), as well as parametric sliders to control Order (number of preceding past states influencing the prediction), Temperature (probability distribution of next token-selection), Output Length (characters or words), and a Seed for reproducibility.
