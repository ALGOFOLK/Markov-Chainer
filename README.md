The *Markov Chain ⟳ Text Playground* is a web-based tool that takes an input text and generates an output text through next-character or next-word prediction. The interface includes clean-up features (removing line breaks and extra spaces), as well as parametric sliders to control Order (number of preceding past states influencing the prediction), Output Length (characters or words), and a Seed for reproducibility.

**Warning:** Typing a few letters into the input box might crash the browser.

**Work in progress:** A copy button for the output text
